# Overview

This project is a clone of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe (TikTakTok) game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a clean 3x3 grid layout where two players take turns marking cells with “X” and “O”. The first player to align three of their marks in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—wins the game. If all cells are filled and no winner is found, the game ends in a draw.

# Technologies Used

HTML – For creating the structure and layout of the game board.

CSS – For styling the grid, game status, and user interactions.

JavaScript – For implementing the game logic (turns, win/draw detection, reset functionality).
